The goal of `imputenet` is to impute missing network data efficiently
and effectively. `imputenet` generates missing ties based on multiple
imputations through collaborative filtering algorithms.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `imputenet` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("saurabh-khanna/imputenet")
```

## Example

Here is a basic example which shows you how to impute missing network
data using `imputenet`:

``` r
library(imputenet)
# basic example code
```

Here is a plot of the network before and after imputations:

``` r
# plot(network1)
# plot(network2)
```
