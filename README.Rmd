# imputenet

The goal of `imputenet` is to impute missing network data efficiently and effectively.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `imputenet` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("saurabh-khanna/imputenet")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(imputenet)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```
